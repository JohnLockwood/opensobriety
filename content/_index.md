If you're fighting to break free of alcoholism or another addiction, you may not know which approach is going to work. 

The good news is, you don't have to know this in advance.

We believe that:

* Individuals should choose which support groups, if any, will help them achieve sobriety, and should mix and match approaches in any way they like.  "Take what you like and leave the rest" or "Throw everything and the kitchen sink at the problem."
