If you're fighting to break free of alcoholism or another addiction, you may not know which approach is going to work. 

The good news is, you don't have to know this in advance.

We believe that:

* Individuals should choose which support groups and/or programs, if any, will help them achieve sobriety, and should mix and match approaches in any way they like.  
* Meetings should be easy to start.  They may or may not have a specific "program" associated with them.  They should be free of central control, but may optionally adopt the [about us statement](/about/) as a preamble.
